# Annotations in Java:

Annotations are metadata that can be added to classes, methods, variables, or other code elements. They do not change the program logic but provide additional information to the compiler or frameworks. Common examples:

`@Override` → indicates a method overrides another.

`@Deprecated` → marks elements that should no longer be used.

`@Test` → used in unit testing.

# Exceptions in Java:

Exceptions allow a program to handle errors or exceptional situations in an organized way. There are two main types:

 - Checked Exceptions → must be handled with try-catch or declared with throws.
 - Unchecked Exceptions → inherit from RuntimeException and handling is optional.

## Advantage:
Using exceptions separates the main logic from error handling, making the code more robust and safe.
